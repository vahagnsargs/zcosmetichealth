Do you hesitate to buy new clothes because they might be ruined by your underarm sweat? Do you constantly worry that someone will notice your sweat stains? Do you find yourself changing clothes often, or putting absorbent materials under your clothing to prevent sweat stains from showing? Most people can control this mild to moderate sweating with over the counter antiperspirants, but for some the sweating is so excessive that it interferes with their daily activities.
