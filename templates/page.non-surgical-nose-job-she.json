In the hands of an experienced surgeon a surgical nose job can provide excellent, permanent cosmetic results. However, some people can be a little anxious or nervous about having nose job surgery. This may be for health reasons, or the inability to afford the downtime or the costs associated with surgery, fear of the risks of surgery, or maybe they just are not sure if they want a permanent result. If this sounds like you, then the Non-Surgical Nose Job may be the perfect way to make your nose appear smaller without having surgery.</p>",

            "author": "During the Non-Surgical Nose Job procedure Dr. Zadeh will use a series of small injections of Juvederm Ultra Plus XC filler placed into very precise locations throughout the nose. Juvederm Ultra Plus XC is a facial filler made of hyaluronic acid which is a naturally occurring sugar found in the human body. Hyaluronic acid delivers nutrients to the skin, and keeps the skin hydrated by holding in water. This adds a natural volume to the skin. When injected in areas of the nose, the Juvederm filler masks the bumps in the nose and straightens the profile of the nose. A droopy tip of the nose can be raised, and deformities shaped to make a crooked or hook nose look straighter. The nose naturally blends in with the rest of the face, is less noticeable and therefore looks smaller. An advantage of Juvederm Ultra Plus XC which Dr. Zadeh uses, is that it contains the local anesthetic lidocaine to give patients a more comfortable injection experience. Lidocaine is used to numb and relieve pain and discomfort associated with a variety of cosmetic and medical treatments. The lidocaine numbs the injection site within seconds, eliminating the need for additional anesthetic injections and thus reducing the overall time of the treatment. The entire procedure takes about 15-20 minutes with virtually little or no pain, bruising or swelling of the nose unlike regular nose job surgery. Results can be instantly seen, and you will be able to return to your normal activities immediately after the procedure. A follow-up visit with Dr. Zadeh is scheduled about three weeks after the initial procedure to evaluate the results of the treatment. Additional touch up injections may be required at this time to achieve optimal results. The effects of a Non-Surgical Nose Job last for one year.Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to make their nose look better without surgery. The Non-Surgical Nose Job procedure cannot shrink a large nose or narrow wide nostrils. Therefore, people with major nasal deformities and those who are looking to significantly reduce the size of their nose are not candidates for the procedure. These patients will need a surgical rhinoplasty.",

            "quote": "<h2>Advantages of Non-Surgical Nose Job Over Traditional Nose Job Surgery</h2>",
            "author": "Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty avoids the risks and complications associated with traditional nose surgery. Since the injections are made only at the level of the skin there is no effect on nasal breathing. The procedure allows more detailed adjustments and precise reshaping of the nose than a surgical nose job. The Non-Surgical Nose Job does not cause nosebleeds or persistent swelling. There is usually no long-term scarring complications. Unlike a surgical rhinoplasty where the patient is under general anesthesia and unconscious, in a Non-Surgical Nose Job the patient is an active participant in the procedure. You will be given the option to hold a mirror in your hand and can help guide the procedure to your satisfaction. The effects of a Non-Surgical Nose Job are temporary, and if unsatisfied with your results after a year your nose will slowly return to its old shape as the filler product is slowly broken down. Most importantly, the cost of a nose job without surgery is 90% less than a traditional rhinoplasty.   If you have always wanted to correct those minor imperfections of your nose, but were hesitant to go to the extreme route of surgical intervention, then consider making an appointment with us to see if the Non-Surgical Nose Job is right for you. At your consultation we will discuss your options for non-surgical vs. surgical rhinoplasty, and whether you are a good candidate for the procedure. The treatment is an in-office procedure and preparation is minimal. Since the face has excellent blood supply, patients are encouraged to stop medications that cause bleeding, such as aspirin, plavix, or ibuprofen products (Motrin, Advil, etc.), a week before the procedure. Mild to moderate pain is alleviated with ice packs to numb the area that is injected.",
