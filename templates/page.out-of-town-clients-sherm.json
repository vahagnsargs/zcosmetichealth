We are conveniently located 25 minutes from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lawa.org\/welcomelax.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)<\/a> and 15 minutes from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.burbankairport.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Hope International Airport in Burbank<\/a>. Our friendly staff is experienced in assisting you with the necessary arrangements to make your experience a memorable one.<\/p><p>It is recommended that you contact us at least one month before your desired treatment date. This will help us develop an efficient schedule for you. A preliminary consultation can be performed by telephone or email to minimize the amount of paperwork needed on your arrival. It will help to inform us of any medical conditions or specific medications you are taking before your arrival. Please plan to arrive at least one day before your scheduled appointment. This will allow us time for any last-minute preparations prior to your treatment.<\/p><p>Our non-surgical cosmetic treatments are all non-invasive and do not require any downtime or anesthesia. If treating multiple areas you may spend up to 3 or 4 hours with us. This will still leave you plenty of time to enjoy what the beautiful city of Los Angeles has to offer!<\/p><p>The Z Center for Cosmetic Health is located in Sherman Oaks and is just minutes away from Beverly Hills, Hollywood, the Getty Center, Universal Studios, and Santa Monica Pier. Dr. Zadeh and his staff would be more than happy to help you in finding accommodations and suggesting nearby attractions to make the most of your time while you are in Los Angeles.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["heading_8NRwcP","text_YXGnqY"],"settings":{"full_width":false,"background":"#ffffff","max_width":1400,"blocks_gap":20,"flex_direction":"column","desktop_content_position":"center","content_alignment":"center","padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40}},"hero_banner_Uxdkg9":{"type":"hero-banner","blocks":{"slide_MmywrD":{"type":"slide","settings":{"banner_layout":"hero-banner--full","color_scheme_text":"text-colors-inverse","color_scheme_background":"background-colors-accent-2","header_menu_text_color":"#ffffff","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/TEAM-Background_1x_6e51b195-9f9e-4576-b817-a21835753299.jpg","video_external":"","enable_media_overlay_desktop":true,"video_external_mobile":"","enable_media_overlay_mobile":true,"content_position_horizontal":"align-center text-center","content_position_vertical":"justify-center","subtitle":"","subtitle_url":"","title":"Now You Can Look Good AndFeel Even Better","content":"<p>Dr. Michael Zadeh | Board Certified General Surgeon<\/p>","enable_vertical_line":true,"button_style":"button--filled","button_text":"Meet The Doctor","button_url":"shopify:\/\/pages\/contact","button_text2":"View more","button_url2":"shopify:\/\/pages\/about"}}},"block_order":["slide_MmywrD"],"settings":{"slider_height":60,"slider_autoplay":false,"slider_autoplay_interval":3,"slider_arrows":false,"slider_arrows_position":"hero__swiper-buttons--sides","slider_arrows_color":"text-colors-inverse"}},"photo_gallery_EDJxnp":{"type":"photo-gallery","blocks":{"column_4YXrpj":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/women-abs-4_1.gif","title":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.zcosmetichealth.com\/procedures\/coolsculpting\">Coolsculpting<\/a>","text":"","link_label":"","link":""}},"column_bGKpgf":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/SM-Lips_2x-1_1.gif","title":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.zcosmetichealth.com\/procedures\/dermal-fillers\">Dermal Fillers<\/a>","text":"","link_label":"","link":""}},"column_U6A8Nr":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/botox-brow1_1.gif","title":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.zcosmetichealth.com\/procedures\/botox\/\">Botox<\/a>","text":"","link_label":"","link":""}},"column_MQ9hqP":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/crows-feet-2_1.gif","title":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.zcosmetichealth.com\/procedures\/ultherapy\/\">Ultherapy<\/a>","text":"","link_label":"","link":""}}},"block_order":["column_4YXrpj","column_bGKpgf","column_U6A8Nr","column_MQ9hqP"],"settings":{"title":"<strong>Photo Gallery<\/strong>","heading_size":"h1","image_width":"full","image_ratio":"adapt","columns_desktop":3,"column_alignment":"left","background_style":"primary","button_label":"","button_link":"","color_scheme":"","columns_mobile":"1","swipe_on_mobile":false,"padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0}}},"order":["main","rich_text_XVVUGL","hero_banner_Uxdkg9","photo_gallery_EDJxnp"]}
