High-Intensity Focused Electromagnetic energy (or HIFEM, for short) and Radiofrequency energy (RF). <\/p><p>The radiofrequency heating causes the muscle temperature to quickly rise by several degrees. This prepares muscles for exposure to stress, similar to what a warm up activity does before any workout. At the same time, the temperature in subcutaneous fat quickly reaches levels that cause fat cell death. The   HIFEM energy causes the muscles, to have supramaximal contractions that are many times more intense than the contractions you induce during a work out. (Note: While these contractions are intense, they are not painful.) These supramaximal contractions cause the body to build muscle, just like they might after a workout. However, since these supramaximal contractions are more intense than the standard muscle contractions you experience during a workout, the body builds muscle more quickly.<\/p>","button_style":"button--filled","button_separator":false,"button_text":"","button_url":"\/","content_layout":"content--relative","block_margin_left":0,"block_margin_right":0,"block_padding_top":0,"block_padding_bottom":0,"block_padding_left":0,"block_padding_right":0}}},"block_order":["tile_CNHF8N","tile_iNjR66"],"custom_css":[".media img {object-fit: contain;}",".media--overlay:after {background: transparent;}"],"settings":{"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":40,"background":"#ffffff","section_width":"max-w-page","section_height":55,"layout":"section-dual-tiles--30-70","gap_between_tiles":0.2,"gap_between_tiles_mobile":0.2,"spacing_top_desktop":6,"spacing_bottom_desktop":6,"spacing_top_mobile":6,"spacing_bottom_mobile":0}},"testimonials_eHxiPN":{"type":"testimonials","blocks":{"testimonial_Dzg8NK":{"type":"testimonial","settings":{"quote":"<p>Am I a Candidate for EMSCULPT NEO®?<\/p>","author":"Anyone who is interested in EMSCULPT NEO , including both men and women, may be a candidate for the treatment.
