For best results, Dysport should be repeated 3-4 times per year. Ideally, your next treatment session should be performed by Dr. Zadeh before the results of your last Dysport injection completely wear off. The goal is to keep the targeted muscles weak all the time. It would be a very good idea to schedule your treatments in advance so there is no period of time that your muscle function returns completely to normal. This will keep your muscles in a weakened state and prevent the wrinkles from worsening.","link_title":"","link_url":""}},"testimonial_CNgqhG":{"type":"testimonial","settings":{"quote":"<h2><strong>What Are Dysport Risks?<\/strong><\/h2>","author":"Dysport is a very safe substance when injected by experienced physicians. The most common risks are those that are associated with the needle injection process and include: bleeding, minor bruising, and possible swelling at the injection site. Allergic reaction and infection are very rare, though possible, risks. Flu like symptoms or minor headaches can occur. Muscle stiffness or weakness can theoretically occur especially in people with Myasthenia Gravis. There can be eyebrow or eyelid droop as well as possible double or blurry vision. Most of the risks are temporary and wear off as the Dysport wears off. It’s important to know that Dysport tends to spread out more than Botox. Therefore, even the same exact injection method can yield slightly different results each time, but these are very insignificant differences.","link_title":"Buy Leo Bikini Bottoms","link_url":"\/"}},"testimonial_tahrHa":{"type":"testimonial","settings":{"quote":"<h2><strong>What Is Dysport Treatment Like?<\/strong><\/h2>","author":"Dysport treatment is quick and non-invasive.
