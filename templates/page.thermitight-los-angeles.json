During the ThermiTight procedure Dr. Zadeh will insert a tiny probe underneath the skin after applying numbing medicine to the area. Radiofrequency heat energy is then applied directly to the target tissues causing immediate shrinkage. This will cause tightening of the skin and melting of fat. Your skin temperature will be monitored using a special device, and will be safe from excessive heating throughout the entire procedure. Results of the treatment can be seen in as early as a few weeks, with the best results occurring over a period of 3-6 months. Clinical studies have shown ThermiTight is safe and effective.","layout":"section_slider_layout--shrink","color_scheme_text":"text-colors-default","color_scheme_background":"background-colors-inverse","button_style":"button--filled","button_text":"Shop now","button_url":""}},"seo_content_kzPLdN":{"type":"seo-content","custom_css":["ul {text-align: left; margin-top: 20px;}"],"settings":{"padding_vertical_desktop":"","padding_vertical_mobile":"","color_scheme_text":"text-colors-default","color_scheme_background":"background-colors-accent-1","text_size":1,"title":"What Areas Or Cosmetic ConcernsCan ThermiTight Treat?","content":"<p>ThermiTight is the best non-surgical facelift alternative available today.
